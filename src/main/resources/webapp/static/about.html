                    The HMS Victory is the world’s oldest warship still in commission with 242 years of service as of
                    2020. Constructed in 1726 in Portsmouth, UK, the ship played its part in many a battle, before
                    separating from its fleet and sinking in October 1744. It was then recovered and reconstructed to
                    play its role in the Battle of Trafalgar against Napoleon. Contributing to one of Britain’s greatest
                    naval victories, the ship was docked at Portsmouth, where it permanently stands on display. Sandford
                    sourced wood directly from the Victory as it was being renovated, memorializing it in his Oak Pens.
                    It’s rare that a material is so significant it has its own chapter in history books and a dedicated
                    Wikipedia page. The Oak Pens come in fountain and roller-ball variants, with precisely made brass
                    parts. The fountain pens are fitted with German-made iridium-tipped nibs that accept standard,
                    disposable ink cartridges and also come with a converter enabling them to be refilled using bottled
                    ink. The rollerball versions come with a high-quality, smooth-writing Waterman refill and are
                    additionally compatible with all Standard International Rollerball refills. The historic English
                    Oakwood is lathe-spun and polished to make up the pen’s body, allowing you to quite literally hold a
                    fragment of history as you write with it!

                    The classically-designed pens possess immense historic relevance, being a part of a warship that
                    molded the course of history, establishing Britain’s naval dominance for centuries. Each pen
                    features a bespoke wood-grain that’s unique to you, and also comes with a Certificate of Provenance,
                    signed by HMS Victory’s current Commanding Officer, as well as a vegetable-tanned leather case, made
                    by Sandford himself. Given the limited quantity of wood at Sandford’s disposal, the pens are a part
                    of an incredibly limited release, and come with a numbered certificate too. It’s almost poetic that
                    the HMS Victory’s journey continues in a series of pens, transforming it from something that oversaw
                    massive war and destruction, to something that is responsible for creation!

                    Throughout the ages, trees have been sentinels and witnesses to events across the woodlands and
                    streams. In the case of the Civil War, for over 140 years these trees are the last silent witnesses
                    to the battles that raged across american nation. We are pleased to offer our Civil War Gettysburg
                    150TH
                    Anniversary Commemorative pens. These are crafted with Witness Tree wood from the Gettysburg Address
                    Honey Locust Tree and commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.

                    The USS North Carolina was commissioned in New York City on 9 April 1941. She was the first of the
                    US Navy’s fast, heavily armed battleships to be commissioned.

                    She took part in every major naval offensive in the Pacific Theater of Operations to become the most
                    highly decorated American battleship of World War II, accumulating 15 battle stars. The USS North
                    Carolina is now a museum ship and memorial kept at the seaport of Wilmington, N.C. She was
                    decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and later stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Registry on June 1st
                    1960. On September 6th, 1961, the ship was purchased by the state of North Carolina to be used as a
                    museum and the North Carolina was later dedicated as a memorial to all North Carolina residents
                    killed during World War 2 and in 1986, the North Carolina was officially declared a National
                    Historic Landmark.
