                    <h1 class="text__title">The HMS Victory</h1>
                    <p> The HMS Victory is the world’s oldest warship still in commission with 242 years of service as
                        of 2020. Constructed in 1726 in Portsmouth, UK, the ship played its part in many a battle,
                        before separating from its fleet and sinking in October 1744. It was then recovered and
                        reconstructed to play its role in the Battle of Trafalgar against Napoleon. Contributing to one
                        of Britain’s greatest naval victories, the ship was docked at Portsmouth, where it permanently
                        stands on display. Sandford sourced wood directly from the Victory as it was being renovated,
                        memorializing it in his Oak Pens. It’s rare that a material is so significant it has its own
                        chapter in history books and a dedicated Wikipedia page. The Oak Pens come in fountain and
                        roller-ball variants, with precisely made brass parts. The fountain pens are fitted with
                        German-made iridium-tipped nibs that accept standard, disposable ink cartridges and also come
                        with a converter enabling them to be refilled using bottled ink. The rollerball versions come
                        with a high-quality, smooth-writing Waterman refill and are additionally compatible with all
                        Standard International Rollerball refills. The historic English Oakwood is lathe-spun and
                        polished to make up the pen’s body, allowing you to quite literally hold a fragment of history
                        as you write with it!</p>

                    <p>The classically-designed pens possess immense historic relevance, being a part of a warship that
                        molded the course of history, establishing Britain’s naval dominance for centuries. Each pen
                        features a bespoke wood-grain that’s unique to you, and also comes with a Certificate of
                        Provenance, signed by HMS Victory’s current Commanding Officer, as well as a vegetable-tanned
                        leather case, made by Sandford himself. Given the limited quantity of wood at Sandford’s
                        disposal, the pens are a part of an incredibly limited release, and come with a numbered
                        certificate too. It’s almost poetic that the HMS Victory’s journey continues in a series of
                        pens, transforming it from something that oversaw massive war and destruction, to something that
                        is responsible for creation!</p>

                    <p> Throughout the ages, trees have been sentinels and witnesses to events across the woodlands and
                        streams. In the case of the Civil War, for over 140 years these trees are the last silent
                        witnesses to the battles that raged across american nation. We are pleased to offer our Civil
                        War Gettysburg 150TH Anniversary Commemorative pens. These are crafted with Witness Tree wood
                        from the Gettysburg Address Honey Locust Tree and commemorate the 150th anniversary of the
                        Battle of Gettysburg.</p>

                    <h1 class="text__title">The USS North Carolina</h1>
                    <p> The USS North Carolina was commissioned in New York City on 9 April 1941. She was the first of
                        the US Navy’s fast, heavily armed battleships to be commissioned.

                        She took part in every major naval offensive in the Pacific Theater of Operations to become the
                        most highly decorated American battleship of World War II, accumulating 15 battle stars. The USS
                        North Carolina is now a museum ship and memorial kept at the seaport of Wilmington, N.C. She was
                        decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and later stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Registry on June
                        1st 1960. On September 6th, 1961, the ship was purchased by the state of North Carolina to be
                        used
                        as a museum and the North Carolina was later dedicated as a memorial to all North Carolina
                        residents
                        killed during World War 2 and in 1986, the North Carolina was officially declared a National
                        Historic Landmark.</p>
